Popular Movies App
========

Application will help you browse most popular and top rated movies from the themoviedb.org service.

### Themoviedb.org API Key is required

In order for the application to function properly, an API key for themoviedb.org must be included
with the build.

Please include your own key for the build by replacing the following string in
[APP_DIR]/.gradle/gradle.properties

You should replace **"__PUT__API__KEY__HERE__"** with **"yourAPIkeyFROMthemoviedb.org"**.
After this operation you will be asked by Android Studio to synchronize your project
And that's it :) I hope that my version of Popular Movies will satisfy you :)

In case if you find a bug... it's not a bug, it's a feature ;)
